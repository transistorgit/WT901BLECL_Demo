# WT901BLECL_Demo
iOS demo app to test the sensor

This app was built to find out how to interact with the WIT Motion WT901BLECL sensor.
The commands and data that the manufacturer documented were implemented and work.

Problem to solve: sensor disconnects after about 90s. As google search shows, thiy may be releated to wrong timings of WIT's peripheral implementation. Waiting for response from them.
